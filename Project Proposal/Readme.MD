**Issue of Interest**
---
My issue of interest for this project pertains to doing an exploratory analysis on real estate data to assess the affect of the Covid-19 pandemic on the U.S Housing market. 
I wanted to understand how the coronavirus outbreak has changed the basic mechanics of buying and selling homes on both the demand and supply side.

**Importance of Issue**
---
The findings can be insightful for homeowners, housebuilders, realtors and investors in the real estate industry to help understand, manage and navigate any disruption and 
uncertainty. Though there may have been external variables that affected total homes sold, inventory of homes and homes delisted, I am assuming that Covid-19 played a larger
role in any changes in the housing market for March-2020 onwards.


**Questions**
---
In this project, I will attempt to answer the following questions:
- How has Covid-19 affected U.S Housing Sales?
- How has Covid-19 affected U.S Housing Prices?
- How has Covid-19 affected the inventory of houses available on the market?
- From the period March - present, how have changes in the areas of sales, pricing and inventory changed?

**Source of Data**
---
I plan to obtain the data from Redfin, a national real estate brokerage, which periodically issues data on the U.S Housing market. All data here is computed daily as either
a rolling 1, 4 or 12-week window. The data will be available for download here: https://www.redfin.com/news/data-center/

**Unit of Analysis**
---
The local data is grouped by metropolitan area and by county. Overall I expect to analyse housing data on 1527 Counties.

**Variables and measures for analysis**
